== Conclusion

Our Lane Departure Warning system implementation successfully demonstrates the viability
of vision-based approaches for detecting unintentional lane departures in various driving scenarios.
Throughout this project, we achieved several key objectives:

* Successfully implemented a real-time lane detection system using YOLOPv2 with inference times averaging approximately 0.0475 seconds (47.5ms) per frame
* Developed a comprehensive testing framework with recording and playback capabilities to ensure consistent evaluation
* Validated our approach against CARLA's ground truth across multiple driving scenarios and environmental conditions
* Established a reliable event publishing system using MQTT for integration with other vehicle systems

The detection performance analysis demonstrated good agreement between our vision-based approach and CARLA's built-in lane invasion detection
across most test scenarios. Our system particularly good at detecting actual lane crossing events with high reliability,
though it occasionally exhibited increased sensitivity in adverse weather conditions.

=== Limitations and Challenges

We encountered several challenges during implementation and testing.
Our system demonstrated higher sensitivity in rainy conditions, resulting in occasional false positives.
Additionally, we had to exclude the rainy night condition from the long test scenario due to a significant issue where the CARLA sensor failed
to detect crossings. This sensor failure caused our model to behave unpredictably,
including skipping frames, making meaningful comparison impossible.

=== Future Work

Based on our findings, several avenues for future improvement include:

* Implementing adaptive detection thresholds based on environmental conditions to reduce false positives in adverse weather
* Developing a more robust testing methodology less dependent on CARLA's built-in sensors
* Extending the system to handle more complex road scenarios, including construction zones and degraded lane markings

Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of modern computer vision approaches for lane departure warning systems while highlighting
areas where further research and development are necessary to achieve production-level reliability across all driving conditions.
