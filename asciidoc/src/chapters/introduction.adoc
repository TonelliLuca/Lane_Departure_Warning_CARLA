=== The Project

This Lane Departure Warning system represents a critical safety feature designed to prevent unintentional lane departures on roadways. Our implementation leverages the CARLA simulation environment to detect when a vehicle begins to drift from its lane, providing timely warnings to alert the driver.

The system employs computer vision techniques, specifically utilizing the YOLOPv2 model, to identify lane markings and determine the vehicle's position relative to these boundaries in real-time. When the system detects an imminent unintended lane crossing, it generates a visual alert, allowing the driver to take corrective action.

This technology serves as an essential component of modern driver assistance systems, helping to reduce accidents caused by driver distraction, fatigue, or momentary inattention.
